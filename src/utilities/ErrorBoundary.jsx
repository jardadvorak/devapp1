// Import the necessary React library and the Component class that we'll extend
import React, { Component } from 'react';

// Create a class called ErrorBoundary that inherits from React.Component
// Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree
class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
    // Initialize the component with its constructor
    // props are parameters passed to the component from its parent
    constructor(props) {
        // Call the parent class (Component) constructor using super()
        // This is required when you have a constructor in a class component
        super(props);
        // Set the initial state with hasError flag set to false
        // This flag will be used to determine if an error has occurred
        this.state = { hasError: false };
    }

    // This is a static lifecycle method that runs when an error occurs
    // Static means it belongs to the class itself, not instances of the class
    // Note: This method must return an object to update the state
    static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
        // When an error occurs, update the state to indicate there's an error
        // This will trigger a re-render with the error UI
        return { hasError: true };
    }

    // This lifecycle method is called after an error has been thrown
    // It receives two parameters: the error itself and the error info object
    // Note: This would be a good place to add error logging service like Sentry
    componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
        // Simply log the error to the console
        // In a production app, you'd want to send this to a logging service
        console.error("Uncaught error:", error, errorInfo);
    }

    // The render method determines what gets displayed
    render() {
        // Check if an error has occurred
        if (this.state.hasError) {
            // If there's an error, show this fallback UI
            // Note: Using inline styles like this isn't ideal for larger applications
            // Consider using CSS classes or styled-components instead
            return <div style={{ padding: '20px', fontSize: '18px' }}>

            </div>;
        }

        // If there's no error, render the children components normally
        // this.props.children refers to any components wrapped by this ErrorBoundary
        return this.props.children;
    }
}

// Make this component available for import in other files
export default ErrorBoundary;

// Some important notes about this implementation:

// Error Boundaries only catch errors in the components below them in the tree
// They don't catch errors in:

// Event handlers
// Asynchronous code (like setTimeout)
// Server-side rendering
// Errors thrown in the error boundary itself



// This is a basic implementation. In a production environment, you might want to:

// Add more detailed error messages
// Include a way to report errors to your server
// Provide a button to retry or reset the error state
// Add more sophisticated error handling logic
// Use proper styling methods instead of inline styles

// Would you like me to explain any particular part in more detail?
